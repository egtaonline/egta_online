# Feature: Schedulers page links to the correct things
#   In order to utilize STI in the interface
#   As a user
#   I want to be able to create multiple types of schedulers from the scheduler page
# 
# @wip
# Scenario: Visiting the schedulers index page shows links for creating new schedulers
#   Given I am signed in
#   And I am on the schedulers page
#   And 1 simulator
#   When I follow "New Game Scheduler"
#   Then I am on the new game scheduler page
  # When I am on the schedulers page
  # And I follow "New Asymmetric Game Scheduler"
  # Then I am on the new asymmetric game scheduler page
