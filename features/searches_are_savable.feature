#   Given I am signed in
#   And 1 simulator
#   And that simulator has the following symmetric profiles:
#     | proto_string |
#     | A, A         |

#   And I am on the games page
#   When I select "a: 2" from "Run time configuration"
#   And I press "View game"
#   Then I should be on the show game page
#   When I fill in "name" for "Name"
#   And I press "Save game"
