# Feature: Resque uses server proxy
#   In order to keep things simple
#   As an admin
#   I want Resque to use the single server proxy
#
# Scenario: Server proxy initially has no accounts
#   Given resque is being used and I add 1 account
#   Then I should have 1 account associated with the server proxy
